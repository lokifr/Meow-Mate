# 🐾 MeowMate – Discover Purrfect Matches for Your Cat Nearby
A fun, clean single-page website I built while learning Bootstrap 5, showcasing landing page design with pricing sections, testimonials, and responsive layouts. This project helped me understand using Bootstrap’s grid system, utility classes, and component structure in real-world practice.

## This is a landing page I built while learning Bootstrap 5 to understand real-world web design.
### In this project, I practiced:

-  Using Bootstrap 5 grid system for responsive layouts
- Applying utility classes for spacing and alignment
- Using Bootstrap components (buttons, cards, pricing cards, navbar, footer)
- Adding SVG icons from Bootstrap Icons
- Structuring sections like Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, Footer
- Linking external CSS and Bootstrap CDN
- Working with responsive images and text
- Practicing clean, semantic HTML

This project helped me understand landing page structure, Bootstrap workflow, and deploying clean UI layouts.
